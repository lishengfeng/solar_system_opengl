Question 3: Suppose that you have the color red already in the color buffer. This is the destination color. If
something is drawn over this with the color green and an alpha (As) of 0.6. Compute the final color after
applying the following blending function combination and using the default additive blending equation:
glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA)
What would be the final color values if you use min and max modes (GL_MIN and GL_MAX) for the
blending equation?

The default Blending mode is GL_FUNC_ADD
1.
R = 0 * 0.6 + 1 * (1-0.6) = 0.4
G = 1 * 0.6 + 0 * 0.4 = 0.6
B = 0
A = 0.6

2. GL_MIN
R = 0
G = 0
B = 0
A = 0

3. GL_MAX
R = 0.4
G = 0.6
B = 0
A = 0.6
